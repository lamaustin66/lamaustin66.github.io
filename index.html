<strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
"Collect" hereby refers to transmitting data off the device and storing it in a readable form for longer than the time it takes the app to service the request.

I do not collect personal information. Any personal assets processed by the app is erased upon the app's termination. It is not stored anywhere even on the device
with the exception of exported frames (initiated by the user). The product is completely free to use
with no obligations, limitations, and never utilizes an internet connection.

</p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
The app requires the user's permission to their photo library
in order to display gif assets to browse. Their associated data
is processed on-device to extract frames from the gifs to export them to the user's photo library in png format.

</p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
I do not employ any third party service and this product is completely offline.

Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me on Twitter at @austinlamdev.
